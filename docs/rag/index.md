Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful approach that combines the capabilities of large language models with external knowledge retrieval. This section covers best practices, case studies, and implementation details for building effective RAG systems.

## Topics Covered

- [Best Practices](best-practices.md) - Guidelines and recommendations for building robust RAG systems
- [Case Studies](case-studies.md) - Real-world examples and implementations
- Technical deep dives into specific RAG components

## Getting Started

If you're new to RAG, start with the [Best Practices](best-practices.md) guide to understand the fundamental concepts and common pitfalls to avoid.
