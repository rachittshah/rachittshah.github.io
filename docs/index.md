# About Me

I'm an Applied AI consultant with a strong interest in startups, venture capital and software engineering.

My personal areas of interest in Applied AI are LLM evaluations.

!!! quote
    The ideal engineer is a composite. He is not a scientist, he is not a mathematician, he is not a sociologist or a writer, but he may use the knowledge and techniques of any or all of these disciplines in solving engineering problems.

## Past Clients

Some of my past clients include:

- Dell
- Razorpay
- Calsoft
- Athina AI
- Literal AI/Chainlit
- Giant Ventures
- Replit
- Arcee AI

*This is a non-exhaustive list.*

## Working Together

I usually operate in two ways:

1. **Secondment to your teams**: act as a part of your team to help you solve your AI problems.
2. **IC**: share me the context of your problem, and I build and fix it for you.

Open to exploring other ways of working if it suits you and your teams.
