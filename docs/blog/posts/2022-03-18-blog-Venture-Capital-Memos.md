## Venture Capital Memos

A very common question asked by aspiring VCs is where do we learn how investments are made? VC is largely a learning on the job role. Feedback cycles take years at the minimum.

> How do you think like a VC?

Enter investment memos: these small documents highlight the usual decision making process of a Venture Capital fund. Many at times, fundraises have memos as well.
