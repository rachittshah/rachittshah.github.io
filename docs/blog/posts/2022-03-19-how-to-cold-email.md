## How to write a good cold email?

If you're looking for job,internship, customers or fundraising, a cold email is your best shoot at reaching out(unless you know people from the organization).

The beauty of cold emailing is that it's a direct and upfront ask, you know what you want, if you don't define and send that email.

* One line about who you are, and what do you do.
   -       Hello {receiver}, I'm {name}, studying/working with {name} and I wish to {request}
* Sharing about yourself
  *        Adding 2 to 5 lines about the key highlights which make you a good fit for the request you've asked.
  *        Be direct, short and crisp. Writing essays isn't saving anyone's time. Be concise and respectful.
  *        Quantify and share your proof of work. If you worked on a feature, show the time it saved or costs reduced. If you gained 100 customers, add that. Show numbers so people understand you better.
  *        Add all relevant links in the email. The reader isn't gonna spend his time looking you up. Respect their time.
* One line about who you are, and what do you do.
   -       Close the email wiht a call to action. Add a personal touch, get as personalized as possible!
