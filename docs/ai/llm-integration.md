# LLM Integration

A comprehensive guide to integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into applications.

## Introduction

Effective LLM integration requires careful consideration of architecture, performance, cost, and user experience. This guide covers key patterns and best practices.

## Integration Patterns

### Direct Integration
- API-based integration
- Self-hosted models
- Batch processing
- Streaming responses

### RAG Integration
- Document processing
- Vector storage
- Query processing
- Response generation

### Fine-tuning
- Dataset preparation
- Training strategies
- Model evaluation
- Deployment considerations

## Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering
- Prompt design patterns
- System messages
- Few-shot learning
- Output formatting

### Performance Optimization
- Caching strategies
- Batch processing
- Response streaming
- Load balancing

### Cost Management
- Token optimization
- Model selection
- Caching policies
- Usage monitoring

### Error Handling
- Rate limiting
- Fallback strategies
- Retry mechanisms
- Monitoring and alerts

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- Input sanitization
- Output filtering
- PII handling
- Audit logging

### Model Security
- Access control
- API key management
- Request validation
- Response filtering

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Key Metrics
- Response times
- Token usage
- Error rates
- Cost per request

### Quality Assurance
- Output validation
- Semantic accuracy
